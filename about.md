We're a group of artists and researchers interested in the creative applications of [Ambisonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics) surround sound technologies. In particular, we're interested in bringing forward [Michael Gerzon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gerzon)'s notion of the sound-field kernel as a technical construct into the real world of artistic practice.
