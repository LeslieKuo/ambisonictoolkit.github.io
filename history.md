<p class="lead">Since 1998 the ATK has existed in a variety of forms.</p>

## Historic

### Csound

In its very first implementation, the ATK was deployed as a collection of Csound(external link) orchestras.

The first publicly presented work created with the ATK is Joseph Anderson’s(external link) Standing Waves at Christchurch, Spitalfields(external link), a sound installation commissioned by the Society for the Promotion of New Music(external link) for exhibition during London’s 1998 Spitalfields Festival(external link).

### SuperCollider2

Development of the real-time ATK library for SuperCollider2(external link) began in 2000.

Anderson’s(external link) Pacific Slope(external link) is the first publicly exhibited work to result, and was first performed in 2002 at the Transparent Tape Music Festival 2(external link) in Berkeley, California. (See also this review(external link) of the premiere.)

### CLM

From 2007, an implementation for the Common Lisp Music(external link) synthesis and signal processing package has been under development.

### VST

In its most recently available form, the ATK has been implemented and installed(external link) as a collection of VST plug-ins(external link).

## Current

### SuperCollider3

The SuperCollider3 version of the ATK is now [available](/download/supercollider/).

### JSFX plugins for Reaper

The port of Ambisonic Toolkit to a set of [JSFX plugins for Reaper](/download/reaper/) started in 2012.

## Anticipated

Following the SuperCollider3(external link) library release, we anticipate a number of further implementations:

* An AudioUnit(external link) library
* Standalone applications
* Python(external link) Library... in development
