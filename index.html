<p>The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) brings together a number of classic and novel tools for the artist working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics" target="_blank">Ambisonic</a> surround sound. The toolset in intended to be both ergonomic and comprehensive, framed so that the user is enabled to ‘think Ambisonic’. By this, the ATK addresses the holistic problem of creatively controlling a complete soundfield, facilitating spatial composition beyond simple placement of sounds in a sound-scene. The artist is empowered to address the impression and imaging of a soundfield &ndash; taking advantage of the native soundfield-kernel paradigm the Ambisonic technique presents.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

The real power in working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics" target="_blank">Ambisonic</a> over other multichannel surround sound techniques is that rather than being restricted to a sound-scene based paradigm (where the artist is presented with tools designed to build up a ‘sound scene’) Ambisonics supports a soundfield-kernel model. Here we construct a soundfield in the abstract, and can then shape it as desired. The result may be shaped into a ‘sound scene’, or perceived this way &ndash; but a soundfield-kernel approach gives much greater flexibility, and directly supports the realisation of more abstract outcomes. We regard this model as idiomatic for Ambisonics.</p>

<p>Along with powerful soundfield transforms &ndash; the spatial filtering tools enabling soundfield-kernel reshaping &ndash; the ATK provides a comprehensive set of Ambisonic encoders (including pseudo-inverse) and decoders (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1" target="_blank">5.1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording" target="_blank">binaural</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHJ_format" target="_blank">UHJ</a>, full-3D) allowing users to thoroughly leverage the power of the Ambisonic technique.</p>

<h2>Platforms</h2>
  
Since 1998 the ATK has existed in a variety of forms....

Historic
Csound

In its very first implementation, the ATK was deployed as a collection of Csound(external link) orchestras.

The first publicly presented work created with the ATK is Joseph Anderson’s(external link) Standing Waves at Christchurch, Spitalfields(external link), a sound installation commissioned by the Society for the Promotion of New Music(external link) for exhibition during London’s 1998 Spitalfields Festival(external link).

SuperCollider2

Development of the real-time ATK library for SuperCollider2(external link) began in 2000.

Anderson’s(external link) Pacific Slope(external link) is the first publicly exhibited work to result, and was first performed in 2002 at the Transparent Tape Music Festival 2(external link) in Berkeley, California. (See also this review(external link) of the premiere.)

CLM

From 2007, an implementation for the Common Lisp Music(external link) synthesis and signal processing package has been under development.

VST

In its most recently available form, the ATK has been implemented and installed(external link) as a collection of VST plug-ins(external link).

Current
SuperCollider3

The SuperCollider3(external link) version of the ATK now available.
See Downloads.

Anticipated
Following the SuperCollider3(external link) library release, we anticipate a number of further implementations:
An AudioUnit(external link) library
Standalone applications
Python(external link) Library... in development
