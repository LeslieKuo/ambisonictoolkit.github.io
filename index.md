---

<p class="lead">The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) brings together a number of classic and novel tools for the artist working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics" target="_blank">Ambisonic</a> surround sound. The toolset in intended to be both ergonomic and comprehensive, framed so that the user is enabled to ‘think Ambisonic’.</p>

<p class="lead">ATK addresses the holistic problem of creatively controlling a complete soundfield, facilitating spatial composition beyond simple placement of sounds in a sound-scene. The artist is empowered to address the impression and imaging of a soundfield &ndash; taking advantage of the native soundfield-kernel paradigm the Ambisonic technique presents.</p>

<p class="lead">The real power in working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics" target="_blank">Ambisonic</a> over other multichannel surround sound techniques is that rather than being restricted to a sound-scene based paradigm (where the artist is presented with tools designed to build up a ‘sound scene’) Ambisonics supports a soundfield-kernel model. Here we construct a soundfield in the abstract, and can then shape it as desired. The result may be shaped into a ‘sound scene’, or perceived this way &ndash; but a soundfield-kernel approach gives much greater flexibility, and directly supports the realisation of more abstract outcomes. We regard this model as idiomatic for Ambisonics.</p>

<p class="lead">Along with powerful soundfield transforms &ndash; the spatial filtering tools enabling soundfield-kernel reshaping &ndash; the ATK provides a comprehensive set of Ambisonic encoders (including pseudo-inverse) and decoders (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1" target="_blank">5.1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording" target="_blank">binaural</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHJ_format" target="_blank">UHJ</a>, full-3D) allowing users to thoroughly leverage the power of the Ambisonic technique.</p>
