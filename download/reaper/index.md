JS FX plugins for Reaper

ATK for Reaper is a set of plugins for the [Reaper DAW](http://reaper.fm). They are developed in the [JS FX](http://reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php) scripting language, and work with all platforms and processors supported by Reaper. Several of the plugins, most noticeably the Transforms, are provided with graphical user interfaces that help visualise the effect of the transform.

Using the ReaJS plugin, part of the ReaPlugs VST FX Suite(external link), ATK for Reaper can also be used with other DAWs on Windows, provided that they support VST plugins.

ATK is now in public beta.
