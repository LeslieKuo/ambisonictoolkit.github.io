## Installing example files for SuperCollider

For full featured Help examples, ATK example soundfiles are required. Install the ATK as above, then download example files here.

Launch SuperCollider3 and run the following code:

Soundfile examples
(
// Place unzipped kernels in the directory opened
// Presume Atk.userSupportDir has already been created
Atk.openUserSupportDir;
)

If the ATK has been correctly installed, the above code will open the ATK's user support directory. Place the downloaded soundfile here.

Note: Users are strongly advised to download and install these files.
